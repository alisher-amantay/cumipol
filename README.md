# cumipol
Endpoint calculator for cumulative interest paid on a loan over a period of time

The solution (endpoint's code itself) is contained in 'serverCUM.py'. 'receiver.py' provides code that can easily connect to the endpoint, 
given that the server is running. 'input.json' is a sample JSON file for testing, 'create_json.py' can easily create desired JSON files for testing and also shows
the expected structure of the file. 'PT_test_task.ipynb' shows step by step process of creating json, loading it, commiting to the server and receieving the result.
